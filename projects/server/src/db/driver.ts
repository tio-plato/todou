/**
 * drizzle's migrator cannot run twice at once on one database. It creates
 * the "drizzle" schema and the journal table and reads the last journal entry
 * outside any transaction, and only then applies the newer migrations in
 * one. Two runs on a database with migrations pending collide on the
 * catalogs' unique indexes (IF NOT EXISTS sees only what is committed), or
 * both apply the same migrations and the later commit fails. Two servers
 * starting with auto_migrate do that, as do two `todou-server migrate` or two
 * test files opening one new database.
 *
 * So a migration first takes a session advisory lock on a connection of its
 * own and runs on that connection; another one tries again every second
 * until it gets the lock, then finds the journal current. The connection is
 * closed afterwards instead of going back to the pool, whether the migration
 * succeeded or threw: a pooled connection still holding the lock (an unlock
 * an error skipped) would hold up every later migration of the database
 * until the pool closed it, which on a busy server may be never. Ending the
 * session releases the lock the same way on both paths. All of it needs one
 * server session throughout, which a transaction-pooling proxy does not give
 * (see docs/deploy.md).
 *
 * It retries rather than blocking in pg_advisory_lock. PostgreSQL grants a
 * blocked waiter the lock even when its process has frozen or died meanwhile,
 * as it notices a dead client only on its next read, and that waiter would
 * then hold up every later migration. A blocking statement also falls under
 * a role's lock_timeout or statement_timeout, and leaves the connection
 * silent for whatever idle timeout lies on the network path.
 *
 * The wait has no timeout. A short one would fail a process queued behind a
 * long but healthy migration, and the case it would rescue, a holder whose
 * machine vanished, lasts until TCP keepalive notices, by default hours.
 * Waiting is logged instead, so a start that hangs says why.
